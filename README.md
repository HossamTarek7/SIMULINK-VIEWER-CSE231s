# SIMULINK-VIEWER-CSE231s

## Description: 
Simulink MDL files are a file format used by the Simulink modeling and simulation software developed 
by MathWorks. MDL files are an alternative to the older Simulink SLX file format and were introduced in 
Simulink version 6.5.
Develop a SIMULINK VIEWER tool using a Java-based graphical user 
interface (GUI) The tool will provide users with the ability to load Simulink MDL files and view their 
contents in a hierarchical structure.

During the project we Assumed that any block is a square shaped and write down the name of the block and has one input and 
one output except the blocks with ports field ( here we have 3 inputs)


The software tool will be useful for engineers, researchers, and students working with 
Simulink models. It will provide a quick and easy way to visualize Simulink
models.
